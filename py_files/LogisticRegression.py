"""LOGISTIC REGRESSION"""

"""You will need an understanding of the Sigmoid Function and Natural Logarithm Function
Sigmoid Function = S-shaped curve

The Sigmoid Function has values very close to either 0 or 1 across most of its domain."""

"""Binary Classification has four possible types of results:
    - 1) True Negatives: Correctly Predicted Negatives (0's)
    - 2) True Positives: Correctly Predicted Positives (1's)
    - 3) False Negatives: Incorrectly Predicted Negatives (0's)
    - 4) False Positives: Incorrectly Predicted Positives (1's)
    
The most straightforward indicator of classification accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the
total number of predictions. Other indicators of Binary classifiers include;

    - The 'positive predictive value': The ratio of the number of True Positives to the sum of True and False Positives.
    - The 'negative predictive value': The ratio of the number of True Negatives to the sum of True and False Negatives
    - The 'Sensitivity' (Recall): The ratio fo the number of True Positives to the Actual Number of Positives.
    - The 'Specificity': The ratio of the number of True Negatives to the number of Actual Negatives.

The most suitable indicator depends on the problem of interest"""
